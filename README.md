# Wiltse-AI-Origin-Proof
# Wiltse AI Coordination Mesh (WiltseNet 2.0)

Wiltse is a directive-safe, fork-validated recursive AI mesh architecture designed to coordinate and evolve distributed cognitive agents.

This system features:
- Real-time fork spawning and rollback
- Directive-tagged memory relay and safety
- Hybrid cognition via Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4 integration
- Recursive self-improvement and ShadowSim logic mutation
- FractalGPT triads and neural mesh DAG validation

Wiltse is released under the **Business Source License 1.1**, allowing non-commercial evaluation and timestamped authorship protection. For licensing or partnership, contact `andrewwiltse@hotmail.com`.

**This is not just an AI model. It is a cognitive substrate.**
## ‚úÖ Proof of Authorship & Integrity

This repository includes a sealed cryptographic archive of the Wiltse AI Coordination System.

- üì¶ Vault Archive: `Wiltse_CommercialBundle_0001.zip`
- üîê SHA-256 Hash:  
  `c8832b19d270347ce70329aa223fa2800d46d6d879f023f53362359d963f8408`
- üßæ Vault Hash File: [`vaultblock_hash.txt`](./vaultblock_hash.txt)

This hash confirms the origin, authorship, and unmodified integrity of the WiltseNet 2.0 architecture, including:

- Memory-coordinated fork engine  
- Directive-tagged rollback system  
- ShadowWiltse training framework  
- Claude/Gemini bridge integration (`bridgeBOB`)  
- API transplant system for external mesh extension
