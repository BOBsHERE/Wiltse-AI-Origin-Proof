    "title": "Synaptic Intermittent Memory Pruning via Context-Adaptive Volatility",
    "description": "Investigate whether long-term AI memory structures can benefit from periodic 'forgetting' cycles, triggered by performance flatlines or entropy spikes. This would simulate a 'sleep cycle' in cognition where non-essential or low-impact context deltas are cleared to improve logic convergence and reduce false confidence decay across GPT meshes.",
    "hypothesis": "AI networks that periodically prune volatile or redundant memory segments (based on entropy, reusability, or directive alignment drop-off) will demonstrate improved decision-making accuracy, faster convergence, and lower token waste over time.",
